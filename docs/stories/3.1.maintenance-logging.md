## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies

This story builds upon completed stories:

- Story 1.1 (User Authentication) - JWT authentication system
- Story 1.2 (Bike Management) - Bike registration and management system

### Data Models

Based on the database schema, this story will interact with:

**Maintenance Records Table Structure** [Source: docs/database-schema.md#maintenance_records-table]:

- `id` (UUID, Primary Key) - Unique identifier for the maintenance record
- `bike_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to bikes.id, Not Null) - Links maintenance to specific bike
- `mechanic_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to mechanics.id, Optional) - Links to registered mechanic (if applicable)
- `service_date` (DATE, Not Null) - Date the maintenance was performed
- `service_description` (TEXT, Not Null) - Description of the service performed
- `cost` (DECIMAL(10, 2), Optional) - Total cost of the service
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, Not Null, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP, Not Null, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, On Update: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

**Existing Bikes Table** [Source: docs/database-schema.md#bikes-table]:

- Already established from Story 1.2
- Foreign key relationship: maintenance_records.bike_id → bikes.id

### API Specifications

**Required API Endpoints**:

- GET /api/bikes/:id/maintenance - List maintenance records for specific bike
- POST /api/bikes/:id/maintenance - Create new maintenance record for bike
- GET /api/maintenance/:id - Get specific maintenance record details
- PUT /api/maintenance/:id - Update maintenance record
- DELETE /api/maintenance/:id - Delete maintenance record

**Request/Response Formats**:

- POST /api/bikes/:id/maintenance payload: { service_date, mechanic_name, service_description, cost? }
- GET responses include full maintenance data with bike ownership validation

### Component Specifications

**Frontend Components** [Source: docs/ui-ux-spec.md#maintenance-management-flow]:

- **MaintenanceModal**: Modal for recording new maintenance
- **MaintenanceForm**: Form component with date picker, text fields, validation
- **MaintenanceHistory**: List component showing historical records
- **MaintenanceCard**: Individual maintenance record display
- **BikeDetails**: Extended to include maintenance access point

### UI/UX Considerations

**Based on UI/UX Specifications** [Source: docs/ui-ux-spec.md]:

- **Modal Interface**: Maintenance entry via modal from bike details page
- **Form Fields**: Date (mandatory), Mechanic (mandatory), Description (mandatory), Value (optional)
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures
- **Save/Cancel Actions**: Standard form controls with proper state management
- **Mobile Responsive**: Forms optimized for smartphone usage

### Technical Constraints

**Security Requirements**:

- Maintenance records must verify bike ownership before any operations
- JWT authentication required for all maintenance endpoints
- Input validation on both client and server side
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

**Performance Considerations**:

- Efficient queries for maintenance history retrieval
- Pagination for users with extensive maintenance records
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Date picker optimization for mobile devices

**Integration Points** [Source: docs/architecture.md]:

- Express.js backend with Prisma ORM for database operations
- Next.js frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Supabase PostgreSQL database for data persistence

### Testing Requirements

**Comprehensive Testing Strategy**:

- Unit tests for maintenance CRUD operations and validation
- Integration tests for API endpoints with proper authorization
- Component tests for React forms and maintenance display
- End-to-end tests for complete maintenance logging workflow
- Security tests for bike ownership verification

## Story Dependencies

- **Requires**: Story 1.1 (User Authentication) - COMPLETED
- **Requires**: Story 1.2 (Bike Management) - COMPLETED
- **Blocks**: Story 3.2 (Maintenance Scheduling) - depends on maintenance data structure

## Estimated Effort

**Complexity**: Medium
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days
**Story Points**: 5
