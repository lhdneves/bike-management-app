# 1. Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
* Locate mechanics in their city
* Be reminded of recurring maintenance
* Control what maintenance has been performed
* Control maintenance-related expenses
* Control the lifespan of components
* Help bicycle owners save money
* Increase the safety of their rides

#### Background Context
This project is about building an application for managing the lifecycle of bicycles, including components, maintenance, and expenses. Bicycle owners typically lack control over their bike's lifecycle, leading to uncertainty about optimal maintenance timing, no record of past services, limited information on local mechanics and their ratings, and no systematic control over individual components. This absence of control results in unoptimized expenses, highlighting a clear need for a solution that provides better management.
