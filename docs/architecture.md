# Bicycle Maintenance, Expense, and Component Control Management System System Architecture

---

## 1. High-Level Overview & Core Components

The system will adopt a **Client-Server architecture**, leveraging modern web technologies to deliver a responsive, secure, and performant application.

The core components will include:

* **Frontend (Client Application):**
    * Developed using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
    * Responsible for the entire **User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX)**.
    * Handles user interactions, renders dynamic content, and communicates with the Backend API.
    * Will be accessible via web browsers (and potentially as a Progressive Web App or mobile-optimized site).

* **Backend (Server-side API):**
    * Built with **Node.js** and specifically using the **Express.js framework**.
    * Exposes **RESTful APIs** to serve data and business logic to the frontend.
    * Manages user authentication using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
    * Handles authorization, data validation, and core application logic (e.g., bike management, maintenance tracking, mechanic location services).
    * Interacts with the database using **Prisma ORM** for efficient and type-safe data access.

* **Database (Data Storage & Realtime):**
    * Utilizes **Supabase**, providing a robust PostgreSQL database.
    * Stores all application data, including user profiles (with **hashed passwords** for security), bicycle details, components, maintenance records, mechanic information, and banners.
    * Leverages Supabase's features for authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage for potentially handling user avatars or other files.

* **Email Service (Integration):**
    * An external service will be integrated with the Backend to handle automated **maintenance reminders** and password recovery emails, ensuring timely communication with users.
